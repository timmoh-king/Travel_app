**My topic is travel planner** - really all im trying to figure out is how to allow the user to create a packing list and use CRUD operations. My app runs but none of the functionality is working if that makes sense like he user can enter a name but its not saving to the database or at least its not showing on the frontend and allowing the user to add items to the list. I just need some help with the function and then to just make it somewhat pretty. I also just plan on running this through a local host. I think that pretty much covers it all. There is a lot of room for freedom.

- I do feel like it is important to not that I use a Mac and need to to run easy and successful on my Mac once its returned.

TravelAPI is the API files and Travel is the blazer app

I've already done 80% of the work just needs some functions and design improvement
I feel like my description could be rather confusing all I need this application to do is to allow a user to create packing list (with a name and items inside) that saves to a database and then use the API to use CRUD function on the list in the database.
